// C5 example: union find structure 2007-11-23

// Compile with 
//   csc /r:C5.dll UnionFind.cs 

/*

The union-find algorithm (Tarjan 1983) is a fast way to build and
maintain a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.  It supports the
following operations on a collection of objects:

 * Create a new one-element subset consisting of a single object.

 * Union (join) two subsets into one.

 * Find the canonical representative of the subset containing a given
   object.

Idea: A subset of values of type T, disjoint from other such subsets ,
is represented by an object Subset<T>.  A HashDictionary<T, Subset<T>>
maps each value to its subset.

  // Problem: The link and rank fields are never used at the same
  // time.  Hence it is tempting to make Eqclass<T> abstract and then
  // have two subclasses, one being canonical and containing only a
  // rank, the other being a non-canonical and containing only a link.
  // However, every subset is born as a Canonical and then may turns
  // into a NonCanonical because of Union operations, and this switch
  // of class while retaining object identity is not possible (Find
  // operations just update the link field; the object remains
  // NonCanonical).  

  // The right thing is to leave Eqclass<T> alone and introduce another
  // class hierarchy Node, Canonical : Node, NonCanonical : Node, and
  // let Eqclass<T> have a field of type Node that can be updated from
  // Canonical to NonCanonical.  But this wastes the space that would
  // be saved by the subclassing idea.

  // Note: Also, this would inadvertently allow two Eqclass<T> objects
  // to share a common Node.  Java and C# confuse things by tying
  // variants (subclasses) together with references (classes).  Since
  // the languages admit (side) effects, sharing is observable and
  // sharability should be decoupled from specialization.
